# Double-Pendulum
Physics simulation of a double pendulum using JavaScript

### Tech Stack
Unlike my [pendulum project](https://github.com/akashom53/Pendulum), I am using p5.js library for this project so I can concentrate more on the logic and physics and let the library manage my boilerplate.

### Mathematics
[This page](https://www.myphysicslab.com/pendulum/double-pendulum-en.html) really hepled me out with the mathematical motion equation for a double pendulum.
